# Geodesic-Agent-Design
A dynamical methodology for geodesic-centric agent design. A persistent identity Hamiltonian (H_core) anchors long-term persona; a context Hamiltonian H_context(t) adapts expression; capability selection uses POVMs. Three bounded dials: C_pers, IDR, D_ver, enable runtime safety and audit.
