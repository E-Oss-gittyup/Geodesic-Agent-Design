# Geodesic-Agent-Design
A dynamical methodology for geodesic-centric agent design. A persistent identity Hamiltonian (H_core) anchors long-term persona; a context Hamiltonian H_context(t) adapts expression; capability selection uses POVMs. Three bounded dials: C_pers, IDR, D_ver, enable runtime safety and audit.

Geodesic Agent Design
This repository contains the theoretical framework and implementation guides for Geodesic Agent Design, a new methodology for building inherently stable and steerable AI agents.

This framework moves beyond traditional prompt-based control, which is often brittle and leads to unpredictable "identity drift." Instead, it proposes a new architectural foundation where an agent's identity is not an instruction, but a dynamical system at the core of its design.

The Core Principle: Architectural Identity
Geodesic Agent Design treats an agent's persona as a mathematical state vector that evolves over time according to a defined "physics." The core of this framework is the Hamiltonian, a mathematical object that defines a stable energy landscape for the agent's desired identity.

Key features of this approach include:

Inherent Stability: The agent's identity is a low-energy attractor state, making it naturally self-correcting and resistant to drift.

Principled Steerability: Control is achieved by shaping the energy landscape itself, allowing for smooth, predictable, and dynamic adaptation to context.

Architectural Safety: Safety mechanisms, such as Boundary Hamiltonians, are built in as restoring forces that prevent the agent from entering pathological states.

Convergent Evidence from Recent Research
The principles of this framework have been independently and empirically validated by recent work in the field. Research from Anthropic, "Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models" (Chen et al., 2025), demonstrates that persona traits exist as controllable, linear vectors within a model's activation space.

This finding provides a concrete, empirical example of the "identity state vector" that is central to Geodesic Agent Design. However, this framework takes the concept a step further:

Persona Vectors (Chen et al.)	Geodesic Agent Design
Approach	Interventional: Measures and corrects existing models.	Architectural: Designs the agent's core dynamics from first principles.
Identity	A static vector representing a fixed trait.	A dynamic state vector that evolves over time.
Control	External Steering: Activations are manually pushed.	Internal Dynamics: Stability emerges from the Hamiltonian's structure.

The "Persona Vectors" research validates that the core mathematical objects of this framework are real and controllable. Geodesic Agent Design proposes that these objects should not just be used for post-hoc intervention, but should serve as the foundational building blocks for the next generation of AI agents.

About This Project
This repository is intended to provide the full theoretical materials, implementation modules, and research tools for developing agents based on this methodology. The goal is to foster an open-source effort to build more robust, predictable, and safer AI systems.
